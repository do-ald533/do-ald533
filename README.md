# Hi there :smiley:, welcome to my github page, i really hope you like my repositories, ENJOY! :grin:
 - I'm currently a junior developer, back-end and front-end technologies and languages student.

- During free time, i always try to learn something new and create a project based on that study.

## A little bit more about me :page_facing_up::
My name is Douglas, i currently only code as hobby but i also want to work with programming.

Most of the times i code i usually get my ideas for projects from math class, although it can be hard and time consuming it's really intriguing seeing the code work the way you wanted, and that is the most satisfying bit about being a programmer.

When i don't have an idea for a project i usually try to solve coding problems, to solve these problems i use the languages: *Python, Node.js or Golang*.

## What is this account for? :confused:
- The main purpose of this account is to show my projects in the programming languages i use, but also to save my projects in a safe place to track, edit and upgrade my code

- Other purpose for this account is to use as a a place to learn more about github and it's features
